		<p><span>You:</span> Hey Mr Scott, My stationary business is a hit! I wanted to expand, would you lend me $1000 again?</p>
		<p><span>Mr. Scott:</span> Sure, But now, the cost of borrowing has changed! </p>
		<p><span>You:</span> Have you increased the rate of interest Mr. Scott?</p>
		<p><span>Mr. Scott:</span> No, the rate of interest is still 10%. But now, I also charge interest on interest.</p>
		<p><span>You:</span> Interest on interest? What does that mean?</p>
		<p><span>Mr. Scott:</span>  That means, you would have to pay 10% on the $1000 that I lend you, AND 10% on the $100 interest. </p>
		<p><span>You:</span> So for the second year, I pay interest on $1100 instead of $1000? </p>
		<p><span>Mr. Scott:</span>  That's correct, that is called compound interest! </p>
